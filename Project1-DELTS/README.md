Hockey is one of the most popular sports in North America. The National Hockey League (NHL) was founded in 1917 and has experienced significant growth and transformation over the years. As a professional league develops, teams improve every facet of their organizations, from arenas and fan engagement to coaching, player acquisition and development. There is also an improvement over time in the players themselves. Professional athletes in general have become bigger, faster, stronger and more specialized as compared to their predecessors.

We were interested in visualizing NHL data to document the league's progression over the last 100 years.

We utilized a set of files that track a variety of NHL statistics from 1917 to present. Datasets include:
-  Team performance
-  Player scoring
-  NHL Draft results
-  League end-of-season awards
-  NHL attendance data

 How have these metrics fluctuated over time and what does the data say about the evolution of the league? How can these changes be explained?
